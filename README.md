# angular-rbr

RBR for **Responsive Line Breaks**.

This module activates and deactivates your line breaks depending on the viewport width!

The history: The origin of this need is mostly because webkit does not support the CSS property `word-break: "keep-all"` for CJK languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean).
Without `word-break: "keep-all"`, CJK line breaks are cut in the middle of any word, which is a complicated task when it comes to responsive websites.

Having responsive line breaks are a need for any text on any device.

You do not want your important sentences or titles beeing cut at random position between words.

## Install

Install with `bower`:

```shell
bower install git://github.com/laurent-le-graverend/angular-rbr.git
```

Add a `<script>` to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular-rbr/angular-rbr.js"></script>
```

And add `llg.rbr` as a dependency for your app:

```javascript
app = angular.module('myApp', ['llg.rbr']);
```

## Use

_For performance reasons, **ECMAScript 5** functions are used. Be sure to include the dependency ES5-Shim if you plan to support non ES5 browsers._

### Just markup!

Use the `rbr` attribute in a normal `br` element in your html:

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor <br rbr class="x-small large" data-ranges="540-700, 1300-1400">sit amet</p>
```

The result of the markup above will trigger a line break when the viewport will match on the ranges or one of the classe intervals.

### Available classes

Each class has three aliases in case if its style is overrided by some of your CSS.

List of classes, and their default viewport value defining when a line break is added:

* `xx-small`, `xxs`, `rbr-xxs-small`, `rbr-xxs`: 0, 320px
* `x-small`, `xs`, `rbr-x-small`, `rbr-xs`: 321px, 480px
* `small`, `sm`, `rbr-small`, `rbr-sm`: 481px, 768px
* `medium`, `md`, `rbr-medium`, `rbr-md`: 769px, 992px
* `large`, `lg`, `rbr-large`, `rbr-lg`: 993px, 1200px
* `x-large`, `xl`, `rbr-x-large`, `rbr-xl`: 1201px, 1440px
* `xx-large`, `xxl`, `rbr-xx-large`, `rbr-xxl`: 1441px, +++

### Ranges

Ranges are an easy way to trigger a line break on specific viewports.
You can define as many ranges as you want in the dataset `data-ranges`; this is not mandatory to use this attribute.

## Configure

Allows you to change the default values for the classes defined above.
